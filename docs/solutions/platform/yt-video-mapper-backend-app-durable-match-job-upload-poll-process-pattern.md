# yt-video-mapper backend app durable match job upload poll process pattern

## Context

The video mapper prototype accepts a downloaded external video and maps it back
to the original Core-sourced video used for analytics attribution. The answer is
not just "some Forge video row": callers need ranked candidates shaped as
`coreId`, `videoVariantId`, `confidence`, and `matchStrength`, where `coreId`
comes from Forge `Video.coreId` and `videoVariantId` comes from Forge
`VideoDub.coreId`.

The first backend slice therefore has to be more than a synchronous demo route.
Video processing is slow, large, and probabilistic; the app needs durable job
state, a transient upload location, a worker/operator drain path, and internal
evidence storage before the real visual/audio/text matchers are swapped in.

## Guidance

Build the app around an async upload job lifecycle:

1. `POST /match-jobs` accepts raw media bytes, stores the upload, creates a
   queued `MatchJob`, and returns `202` with `{ jobId, status }`.
2. `GET /match-jobs/:jobId` polls job state. Once complete, it returns only
   `{ candidates }` so the public contract stays focused on attribution.
3. `POST /match-jobs/:jobId/process` lets an authenticated worker or operator
   drain a job explicitly. Runtime defaults should keep auto-processing off;
   tests can opt into auto-processing when useful.

Use a Prisma-backed repository as the production default and keep in-memory
repositories test-only. The job claim should be atomic and recover stale running
jobs:

```typescript
await db.matchJob.updateMany({
  where: {
    id: jobId,
    OR: [
      { status: "QUEUED" },
      { status: "RUNNING", startedAt: { lte: staleStartedBefore } },
    ],
  },
  data: { status: "RUNNING", startedAt, safeErrorCode: null },
})
```

Treat uploaded files as transient job inputs, not durable evidence artifacts.
Store the upload before creating the job, clean it up if job creation fails, and
clean it up again when processing reaches a terminal state. Keep a retention
timestamp on the job result so a later reaper can remove old rows.

Keep the catalog identity model explicit:

```text
CatalogVideo.coreId      -> canonical source video answer
CatalogVariant.coreId    -> parent source video
CatalogVariant.videoVariantId -> matched Core videoVariant.id
```

Candidate and signature rows should reference variants by the composite
`coreId + videoVariantId`, not by variant alone. This prevents evidence for one
Core video from being attached to a same-named or drifted variant identity.

Keep evidence internal. `MatchEvidence` can store visual, audio, text, duration,
and fusion details for review, but the public response should remain:

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "coreId": "core-video-id",
      "videoVariantId": "core-video-variant-id",
      "confidence": 0.913,
      "matchStrength": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

For retrieval, avoid a metadata-first RAG shape. The useful primitive is a media
signature retrieval layer over official variants, followed by fusion. The
prototype has placeholder retrievers, but the seam should already model visual,
audio, text, and duration signals and merge by `coreId + videoVariantId`:

```typescript
const key = `${signal.coreId}:${signal.videoVariantId}`
```

Fuse multimodal evidence with visual as the source-video anchor and audio/text
as variant-ranking evidence. Normalize by available signals so sparse evidence
does not get unfairly penalized, but cap non-visual or weak-visual candidates
below high confidence. In the prototype, a candidate without a strong visual
anchor cannot exceed `0.84`, keeping `matchStrength: "high"` reserved for cases
with source-video support.

## Why This Matters

Analytics attribution needs the canonical Core video identity and the likely
variant identity. Returning only a source video can lose language or dub
information; returning only a variant can make the source attribution harder for
callers to use.

Durable async state prevents the usual prototype failure mode where a large
upload either blocks the HTTP request until it times out or disappears if the
process restarts. A worker drain endpoint also makes the app deployable before a
full queue runner exists.

Keeping evidence internal lets the team inspect and tune the matcher without
committing every diagnostic detail to the public API. That matters for future
fusion work, because visual and audio evidence can disagree: visual should
usually decide the source video, while audio and transcript evidence should help
choose the best variant.

## When to Apply

- A backend app accepts uploaded files that need slower processing before a
  result can be returned.
- The public API needs ranked candidates, not a single irreversible best guess.
- A matcher needs both parent identity and variant identity.
- The app needs a prototype path before the real queue, catalog sync, and media
  indexing workers are complete.
- Evidence is valuable for debugging but should not be exposed to callers yet.

## Examples

Good route shape:

```text
POST /match-jobs                  -> 202 { jobId, status }
POST /match-jobs/:jobId/process   -> authenticated worker drain
GET  /match-jobs/:jobId           -> queued/running/failed envelope
GET  /match-jobs/:jobId           -> { candidates } when complete
```

Avoid these shortcuts:

- Defaulting production runtime to an in-memory repository.
- Letting job processing rely only on fire-and-forget auto-processing.
- Keying fusion by `videoVariantId` without the parent `coreId`.
- Exposing internal visual/audio/text evidence in the public response before
  the API contract calls for it.
- Treating title or metadata search as the foundation for matching reuploads.

Prototype caveats to address before large-scale operation:

- The raw upload route currently buffers the request body before storage;
  streaming upload storage is the next hardening step for large files.
- `retentionExpiresAt` is recorded, but a cleanup worker still needs to delete
  expired job rows and any leftover uploads.
- Bearer-token access protects the service surface, but per-caller job
  ownership is not yet modeled.
- Catalog sync, media signature indexing, and labeled evaluation data still need
  to be built before confidence thresholds should be trusted operationally.
